Description: GNU C compiler for the Motorola/FreeScale 
 m68hc11/m68hc12/mc9s12x processors. This is the GNU C compiler, a 
 fairly portable optimizing compiler which supports multiple languages. 
 This package includes support for C for cross-compiling to a Motorola 
 m68hc11/m68hc12/mc9s12x microcontroller-based target.
